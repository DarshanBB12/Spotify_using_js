## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` or `spotifysong.html` in a web browser
2. Click on any song in the list to **select** it (this loads the song but doesn't play it)
3. Use the master play/pause button at the bottom to start/stop playback
4. Use previous/next buttons to navigate between songs
5. Drag the progress bar to seek within a song
6. The player will automatically move to the next song when current song ends

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and audio elements
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation and audio controls
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for controls

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support HTML5 audio:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Customization

To add more songs:
1. Add audio files to the `songs/` folder
2. Add cover images to the `covers/` folder
3. Update the `songs` array in `spotifysong.js` with new song data

Example:
```javascript
{ songName: "New Song Name", filePath: "songs/11.mp3", coverPath: "covers/11.jpg", duration: "04:15" }
```
